Cheat Max (Schummel Max)</A>
</H2> 
This game is called "Schummel Max" in German and is very easy to
learn. Only if you cheat well can you win this game.
The minimum number of players is two but four to sixe is better. 
<BR>
<BR>
You need dice, a dice box, a beer mat and a
matchbox. All players get three matches for one play.
<BR>
<BR>
One player starts the game by shaking the dice between the beer mat
and dice box. Then he looks under the dice box to see the value of the
dice. He has to hide the result. The player 
says the value or a higher number to the next player. The next player
has to trust it or not. If he believes, then the first player hands
over the dice box to him and then he has to throw a higher number.
<BR>
<BR>
But if the second player didn't rely, then the first player has to show him
the dice. If the first player has lied so he has to put away one
match. So other way round the unbeliever loses a match. Afterwards the
next player has the next turn. If he has trusted so he has to have a
higher score then before. Otherwise he can start from scratch.
<BR>
<BR>
So the rules are very simple. Everybody has to have a higher level
(real or not) than his predecessor. Now it's time to explain the
kind of value counting. 
<BR>
<BR>
The highest virtue of both dices is always the decimal. So a three
and one or one and three is 31, a six and a five is 65. 
The numbers 21, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55 and 66 are particularly values. 
Except they we count from 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62,
63, 64 to 65.  The next higher level are the double numbers: 
11, 22, 33, 44, 55 and 66. They called in German "Pasch" (doublets): 
one-douplets, two-douplets, ... The highest level is 21, called "Max". 
If you get this then you have to show it and all players have to 
lay a match aside and the play direction turn back. 
And you throw again but to the partner an the other side.
<BR>
<BR>
If a player has lost all matches then he is "swimming" one round. If he
is a looser again so he leaves this game. At the end the winner is the last
player of this round.
<BR>
<BR>
This game is a lot of fun. You can see who is good at lying.
